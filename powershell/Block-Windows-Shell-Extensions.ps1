.SYNOPSIS
    This script can be used to prevent specific shell extensions from being loaded by Windows Explorer.
    Explorer must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script adds a specified shell extension to the block list in the Windows registry.
    If a class ID is provided, it will be added directly to the block list.
    If a name is provided, it will look up the class ID in the approved list before blocking.
    The script can also force the addition of an extension to the block list even if it is not found in 
    the approved list. However you must specify a class ID to block with the -Force "true".
    
    The approved and blocked extensions are managed in the following registry keys:
    - Approved: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell Extensions\Approved`
    - Blocked: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell Extensions\Blocked`
    
.EXAMPLE
    Block-Windows-Shell-Extensions.ps1 -Extension "{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}" -Force "true"
    This will block the shell extension with the specified class ID, even if it is not found in the approved list.
    
    Block-Windows-Shell-Extensions.ps1 -Extension "Some Extension Name"
    This will look up the class ID for "Some Extension Name" in the approved list and block it.
.OUTPUTS
    Logs the actions taken to the console, including whether the extension was found in the approved list,
    whether it was added to the block list, and any warnings if the extension was not found.
.NOTES
    2025-06-18: Initial version of the script.
